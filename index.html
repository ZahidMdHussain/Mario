        <p>
          One day the kingdom of the peaceful mushroom people was invaded by the
          Koopa, a tribe of turtles famous for their black magic. The quiet,
          peace-loving Mushroom People were turned into mere stones, bricks and
          even field horsehair plants, and the Mushroom Kingdom fell into ruin.
          Mario hears about the Mushroom People’s plight and sets out on a quest
          to free the Mushroom Princess from the evil Koopa and restore the
          fallen kingdom of the Mushroom People.<br />
          The only one who can undo the magic spell on the Mushroom People and
          return them to their normal selves is the Princess Toadstool, the
          daughter of the Mushroom King. Unfortunately, she is presently in the
          hands of Bowser, the King of the Koopa. <br />
          You are Mario! It’s up to you to save the Mushroom People from the
          black magic of the Koopa!

        For the past 35 years, Mario has been running, jumping, and saving the
        Mushroom Kingdom from bad guys, and he couldn’t have done it without
        you. Thank you for always being there to help Mario on his incredible
        adventures.
